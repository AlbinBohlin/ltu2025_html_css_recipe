        <h3>Preperations:</h3>
        <p>Take a pack of bacon and gently seperate the slices. Allow to rest, preferably until both the eggs and bacon reach roomtemperature (might take longer than 10 min..).</p>
        <p>Ground a healty pinch of peppercorns coarsely</p>

        <h3>The bacon</h3>
        <p>Heat upp a thick bottom cast iron or steel skillet togheter with the butter until the butter stops foaming and add the bacon. </p>
        <p>The butter helps to faciliate the rendering of fat from the bacon and gives a more crisp golden crunch to the meat. Once the fat has fully rendered the heat will rise quickly in the pan so lower the temperature in anticipation and allow to simmer in the fat until almost not quite golden.</p>
        <h3>The eggs</h3>

        <p>Arrange the bacon strips close togheter and crack the eggs on top of the bacon avoiding the bottom of the pan. Season with ground pepper(No salt!). Turn of the heat and let the pan sit on the hot plate with a lid on for 2-3 minutes until the eggs has coagulated enough to allow you to gently seperate and flip the bacon bottomed eggs. Remove from hotplate and allow to rest for an additional 1-2 min depending on how runny you like your yolk.     </p> 

        <p>plate on toast or whatever type of bread you prefer. I use good old Wasa husman crispbread. </p>
